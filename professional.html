                <p class="body-copy">Ryan Fabian started having an interest in web development and software development in general during his time in the Air Force. He started out with little tutorials and youtube videos, and ended up interning at a major Agency in Los Angeles, where he got his start. Here is a collection of some of his works.</p>

                <p class="body-copy">Ryan's mentor would give him small tasks at the early stages of his training, one of which was to create a small contact list using only HTML5 and CSS. Only, his mentor was a forward thinker and did not want Ryan starting his career learning bad habits, so he forced Ryan to write code that was commesurate with a mid level developer, utilizing SCSS as a preprocessor for his styles. SCSS was also used to build the styles for this website. You can see the code and the final product here:
