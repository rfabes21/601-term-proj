                <p class="body-copy">Ryan Fabian started having an interest in web development and software development in general during his time in the Air Force. He started out with little tutorials and youtube videos, and ended up interning at a major Agency in Los Angeles, where he got his start. Here is a collection of some of his works.</p>

                <p class="body-copy">Ryan's mentor would give him small tasks at the early stages of his training, one of which was to create a small contact list using only HTML5 and CSS. Only, his mentor was a forward thinker and did not want Ryan starting his career learning bad habits, so he forced Ryan to write code that was commesurate with a mid level developer, utilizing SCSS as a preprocessor for his styles. SCSS was also used to build the styles for this website. You can see the code and the final product here:

                <p class="body-copy">After a few months interning at an Agency in LA, Ryan was feverishly training his skills to work on becoming a full stack developer. He loved Python, and the freedom and ease-of-use that frameworks like Django and Mezzanine afforded a budding backend developer. As the intern, he was tasked with doing grunt work for a project that was a huge account for the Agency, which he completely dominated. Of the 3 backend devs tasked to build this new site, <a href="http://senacases.com">Sena Cases</a>, only 1 of them was well versed in Python Django, which is what it was going to be built on. This allowed Ryan to really shine, since the site utilized some heavy Python Django code as well as a ton of animations, and he was offered a full time job on the spot (while the two compainer-devs that didn't want to learn Python were fired.) You can see the finished site here: <a href="http://senacases.com">Sena Cases</a>.

                <p class="body-copy">Now that Ryan had some good experience under his belt and he felt comfortable venturing out on his own, he started looking for freelance jobs. One particularly lucrative side job fell into his lap after meetinga new friend at the gym who wanted a new website for his jewelry company. Ryan flexed all his muscles with Python Django, HTML, SCSS, and Javascript to really make something amazing. Since this site was designed for the client by Ryan as well, it was definitely his baby. <a href="https://www.misahara.com">Misarah Jewelry</a> is a high couture, extremely rare designer jewelry company that is owned by Lepa Galeb-Roskopp, who is the wife of Rob Roskopp, the owner of Santa Cruz Bicycles. She is from Porto Montenegro, and gave Ryan a chance to build her a new site. <a href="https://www.misahara.com">Misarah Jewelry</a> launched in June, 2015.
